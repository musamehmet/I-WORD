# What's I-WORD?

I have determined my motivation for creating this application according to my own needs. I was using physical ways to improve my English vocabulary. For example, I was writing English words on small pieces of paper and throwing them into a box, trying to guess the meaning by randomly pulling words from the box. This method both wastes paper and requires me to be dependent on a certain place. For example, I could only carry out this study method from home. This is where **I-WORD** comes into play!
**I-WORD** is a web application that allows you to study a vocabulary and improve it simultaneously with other users. Users can register English words that are not registered in the system by specifying their meaning, pronunciation form, pronunciation region.

**Statistics**

The total number of words and sentences added to the system daily and up to that day can be followed instantly by all visitors.


**User Skills**

**I-WORD** distinguishes between logged-in and non-logged-in users.
Non-logged-in users can only view the words, sentences and leaderboard ranking in the system. Logged-in users, on the other hand, can view the words, sentences and leaderboard ranking in the system, as well as add new words and sentences to the system, edit the words they have added, view and edit their own profile pages, view and follow another user's profile page, and unfollow.


**Add Word and Add Sentence**

Users logged in to the system can add words and sentences to the system via the ADD and SENTENCES buttons on the Home page. When a user wants to add a word that has already been added to the system, he/she will see a warning on the Home page and will see that this word has already been added. If a user does not include the word he/she has chosen while making a sentence, he/she will be warned by the system and will see a warning stating that he/she cannot make a sentence if he/she cannot use the word.


**Searchbox**

Thanks to the search box, you can search for words added to the system. The search result is displayed as a list, if there is a related word, you can go to its page.


**Make Sentence**

By using the words saved in the system in sentences, the exercise of the specified word is carried out in a highly efficient online environment in a structure in which other users can participate. For example, user b will be able to use a word added by user a in a sentence.


**Words Page**

With the Words page, users can view all the words added to the system. The pagination feature becomes active after 20 rows during listing.  They can use the word they examine in a sentence. In addition, with the possibility of filtering on the words page, they can filter the words added by the users they follow or the words they add themselves.


**Sentences Page**

With the sentences page, users can view all sentences added to the system. The pagination feature becomes active after 20 rows during listing.  They can see which word is used in the sentence they are analysing. In addition, with the possibility of filtering on the sentences page, they can filter the sentences added by the users they follow or the sentences they add themselves.


**Score System**

Score system, thanks to this system, users get 25 points for each word they add to the system. Provided that they have not used that word before, they earn 50 points for each sentence they add. The user's profile score is calculated by adding 40 per cent of the word score and 60 per cent of the sentence score. The profile score determines where the user will rank in the Leaderboard rank.


**Profile Page**

With the Profile page, users can view their own profile information or other users' profile information. On the profile page, each user's rank information, word score, sentence score and profile score are displayed.


**Leaderboard Page**

All users who are ranked according to their profile score can be displayed on the Leaderboard page. The pagination feature becomes active after 20 rows during listing. This method encourages users to add more words and sentences to the system and contributes positively to their motivation.
This system is completely open for improvement. For example, by pulling vocabulary information from various free libraries via API, we can save users from the trouble of adding words to the system. However, I gave up this development structure as I thought that this convenience might have a negative impact on its development! In addition, by introducing a level system (Beginner, Advanced, Profiency etc.) depending on the profile score of the users, sharing between the ranks of the users can be facilitated.


**Administrator Interface**

Users defined as administrators can log in to an interface where they can easily control the data added to the system. In this interface, information entry and update operations regarding follow-up, words, sentences and users can be performed.


**Responsive Design**

**I-WORD** has a responsive design for working on mobile devices.


**Outro**

Yes, this is all I have to tell about **I-WORD** for now. Thank you very much for taking the time to analyse my project.
